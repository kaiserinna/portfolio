LEARNING DIARY

25.4.2024

Finally, I found time to enroll to this course. I went through Moodle pages and was glad to notice that we use Git as a version control system. I had just learned how to use it on Olio-ohjelmointi course. I had used GitHub, so I created an account also to bitbuket. I had previously used VSCode and Android Studio, so that I had already covered, but I installed the extensions for Code.  I got also excited about learning a new language, since I only know Python and Java. Took a sneak peek on the first video, but didn’t watch it through, I had such a little time to get into thins today.

Today I installed some of the last installations for Code. I watched the first video and made the first commit to git. I started the second video but didn’t finish this one. I couldn’t get then fontawesome icons to work. I’ll see to that tomorrow. But this seems cool, I have thought that I would need a portfolio for my code work. Nice.

3.5.2024
I had only a little time today but I got the icons and the fonts to work.

6.-7.5.2024
I forgot to write this every day, but during these 2 days I got the portfolio background to look nice. I wanted to put a gif in staid of a jpg as a background. I had a little help from ChatGPT. And actually, I had the videoclip as a mp4, and chatGPT said it would work fine with it, but it didn’t. I thought I had a problem with the path, as when I pressed “follow path” it couldn’t find the mp4 or the pictures I put on the file the same way the video showed. So I used quite some time to figure out how the path commands work (.. and / and .) but then I finally got it to work and realized that probably the vscode finds the path differently than the browser, so maybe it was the reason for that. Then I googled a bit more why the mp4 doesn’t work, and I understood that it might work better if I changed the mp4 to gif. And then I finally got it to work, and I’m super happy with the result. I also spent some time taking new selfies to use as a portfolio picture.

8.5.2024
Today I watched the 3rd video, I followed the instructions carefully, but for some reason the menu button didn’t work. I wanted to add a little more spinning effect, idk if it was classy but I wanted to play around with it. So I just needed to go through the code again, and I found some typos, and made the same node control C, run sass and save thing and it worked. I got all the menu nav elements and headers to work with effects and adjusted the portraits to way I wanted them. Also, I didn’t what to do the effect of changing the color on so many points, because it would have gotten mixed up in my secondary color.

31.5.2024
So, I completely forgot to write this. I watched the rest of the videos last week, and was completely sucked into this. I did all kinds of tricks, within my abilities, googled a little bit more about css online and got a “Java Script – the best parts” book, that I’m going to read during the following summer months. I think I finally got the project to the stage I can return this, but I’m definitely going to continue with this. I still have to make 3 buttons to the main.scss that change the language of the whole website. I googled a little bit and noticed that it should be doable, but didn’t have time to dwell into it just yet. But thanks for a great introduction course!! I loved this!! 

20.5.2024
Okay so I do still have some tiny bugs on the page, and I definitely continue developing this. I still want the language change and own domain. But unfortunately I have had so much going on in my sons health so I’ve had to push this return date. I hope everything will go smoothly. But I loved this course, I wish there was more of these.
